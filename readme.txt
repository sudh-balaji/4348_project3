This project simulates an operating system by providing a simple memory manager that allocates and deallocates space
for the incoming processes. The scheduler class schedules the processes in a round robin fashion.

To run this code:
1) set the name of the input file with the size to be allocated per process and name of process file (ex: 40 loop50.txt)
2) type in "make" in terminal
3) execute using "./main"
4) output prints out 30, 150, and 230 in memory
